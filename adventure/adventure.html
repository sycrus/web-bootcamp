    <div>“Welcome to Times Square!” <br>
        
        <br>

        The guide yells coarsely into a miniature megaphone, competing with the cacophony of sales pitches from Broadway ticket sellers, <br>
        touts from the mascot mafia (especially from a Catwoman impersonator), and the blare from the old skool boomboxes from various street performers. <br> <br>
        She is failing miserably. <br>
        
        <br>
        
        This is your first day in New York, and your tour agency has swiftly whisked you to the middle of Times Square. <br> <br>
        Camera in hand, you wait expectantly for a magical moment to appear. Maybe a celebrity sighting, <br>
        a spontaneous performance by the Broadway cast of Lion King, a rat dragging a pizza across town... <br>
