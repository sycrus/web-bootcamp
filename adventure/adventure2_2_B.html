        You walk away from the turnstiles, much to everyone elseâ€™s relief. <br>
        
        <br>

        Examining the door, it seems to open only from one side. <br>
        
        <br>

        You look for a way to open it while other commuters glare condescendingly at you. What gives? <br>
        
        <br>

        What do you do? <br>

    <a href="adventure2_2_BB.html">Try waiting for a while at the door. Maybe it will open?</a> <br> <br>
