        You look around you. A grilled door is to your left, and the turnstile is to your right. <br>
        
        <br>

        In front of the turnstile is a device that looks like you can swipe a card through; on the device are a stack of discarded MetroCards. <br>
        
        <br>

        Behind you are a bunch of angry commuters who look like they are in a rush. <br>

        <br>
        What do you do? <br>
