        You follow the stranger down the Subway, but he disappears at the turn. <br>

        <br>

        Braving the stenches of a short flight of stairs, you arrive at a metal cage, <br>
        or what the New Yorkers call a “baby-back-ribs-of-death” ceiling-to-floor turnstile.<br>
        Through the cold metal bars, you catch a glimpse of the stranger running down the stairs.<br>
