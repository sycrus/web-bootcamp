        <div align="center"><p>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: <br>  
            All mimsy were the borogoves, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mome raths outgrabe. <br></p></div>
    
        <div align="center"><p>“Beware the Jabberwock, my son! <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br> 
        Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The frumious Bandersnatch!” <br></p></div>
    
        <div align="center"><p>He took his vorpal sword in hand; <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     Long time the manxome foe he sought— <br>
        So rested he by the Tumtum tree <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      And stood awhile in thought. <br></p></div>
    
        <div align="center"><p>And, as in uffish thought he stood, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame, <br>
        Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      And burbled as it came! <br></p></div>
    
        <div align="center"><p>One, two! One, two! And through and through <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The vorpal blade went snicker-snack! <br>
        He left it dead, and with its head <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    He went galumphing back. <br></p></div>
    
        <div align="center"><p>“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock? <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come to my arms, my beamish boy! <br>
        O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!” <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He chortled in his joy. <br></p></div>
